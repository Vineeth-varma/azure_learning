## Azure
* Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like AI and Internet of Things (IoT).
## Cloud Computing
* It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
* Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
  *   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
      * Lower your operating costs.
      * Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
      * Scale as your business needs change.

## Cloud Models 
**Public Cloud**
  * Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.

**Private Cloud**
* A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

**Hybrid Cloud**
* A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Cloud model comparison
**Public cloud**
* No capital expenditures to scale up.
* Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
* Organizations pay only for what they use.

**Private cloud**
* Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
* Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
* Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.

**Hybrid cloud**
* Provides the most flexibility.
* Organizations determine where to run their applications.
* Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.

## Cloud computing benifits
* There are several advantages that a cloud environment has over a physical environment that Tailwind Traders can use following its migration to Azure.

**High availability:** Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

**Scalability:** Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:

* Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
* Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.

**Elasticity:** You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.

**Agility:** Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

**Geo-distribution:** You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

**Disaster recovery:** By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

## Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
* Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.

**A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:**
* No upfront costs.
* No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
* The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
* The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

## Cloud Services
**IaaS - Infrastructure-as-a-Service**
* This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers; a cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational virtual compute devices running in Microsoft datacenters. An advantage of this cloud service model is rapid deployment of new compute devices. Setting up a new virtual machine is considerably faster than procuring, installing, and configuring a physical server.

**PaaS - Platform-as-a-Service**
* This cloud service model is a managed hosting environment. The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment. For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical hardware and software requirements.

**SaaS - Software-as-a-Service**
* In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. All you need to do is create your content, and Office 365 takes care of everything else.

## Serverless Computing
* Like PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.
* It's important to note that servers are still running the code. The "serverless" name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. This approach enables developers to increase their focus on the business logic, and deliver more value to the core of the business. Serverless computing helps teams increase their productivity and bring products to market faster, and it allows organizations to better optimize resources and stay focused on innovation.
